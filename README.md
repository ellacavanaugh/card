This project was attempting to deliver my style and personality in a one page business card style website. My website shows my personality by showcasing a bright, bubbly, loud and fun design.
I feel like my project really stands out because of all the elements of it - you have the bubblegum animation and the fun, personalized comic strip. 
I used the font fira-sans, a bold, almost blocky font that makes my name and title stand out throughout all the chaos of the rest of the website lol
My personal branding is always changing based off my mood and interests at the time, which is why this project was difficult for me at first because I didn't know which aesthetic to go with. I truly like most styles of design, from pop art to simplistic to maximalist. I feel like this type of style truly captures me at any point though, it's fun and it's happy, and it's out there.
